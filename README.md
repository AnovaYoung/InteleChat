# InteleChat
AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot
### Project Name: "InteleChat: AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot"

### README

#### Project Overview
**InteleChat** is an AI-powered customer support chatbot designed to handle complex queries, provide accurate information, and enhance customer satisfaction. This project leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) such as DBRX, Mistral, Mixtral, and Llama-3 to create a highly effective customer support system. The project encompasses model research, data collection, model fine-tuning, integration, testing, deployment, and comprehensive documentation.

#### Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   - `git clone https://github.com/username/InteleChat.git`
   - `cd InteleChat`

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - `python3 -m venv env`
   - `source env/bin/activate`

3. Install dependencies:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Objective**: Gather and prepare data for training the chatbot.
- **Steps**:
  - Collect customer support datasets from public sources or generate synthetic data.
  - Use `data_preprocessing.py` to clean and preprocess the data.

#### Model Fine-Tuning
- **Objective**: Fine-tune LLMs on the prepared customer support data.
- **Steps**:
  - Choose one or more LLMs (DBRX, Mistral, Mixtral, Llama-3).
  - Use `model_finetuning.py` to fine-tune the models with optimal hyperparameters.

#### Integration and Development
- **Objective**: Integrate the fine-tuned LLMs into a chatbot framework.
- **Steps**:
  - Select a chatbot framework (e.g., Rasa, Botpress).
  - Use `integration.py` to integrate the LLMs with the chosen framework and connect to backend systems.

#### Testing and Evaluation
- **Objective**: Test and evaluate the chatbot’s performance.
- **Steps**:
  - Use `evaluation.py` to conduct performance tests and analyze metrics.
  - Perform user testing to gather feedback and improve the system.

#### Deployment and Monitoring
- **Objective**: Deploy the chatbot to a cloud platform and set up monitoring.
- **Steps**:
  - Use `deployment.py` to deploy the chatbot on AWS/GCP.
  - Implement monitoring using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

#### Documentation and Presentation
- **Objective**: Document the project and prepare a presentation/demo.
- **Steps**:
  - Write comprehensive documentation (`docs/`).
  - Prepare a presentation highlighting key aspects and a live demo.

#### Future Work
- Expand the chatbot’s capabilities to handle more complex queries.
- Integrate with additional backend systems.
- Continuously update and improve the models with new data.
